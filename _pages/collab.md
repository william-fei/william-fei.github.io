Art is better with other artists! Right now, I'm focusing on my **Renderscapes** photo + 3D project, and I'm interested in collaboration with (human) models and 3D artists.

## Models - prepping for a photoshoot

**Wardrobe**:

- Bring 4-5 outfits and at least one pair of boots
- Futuristic, formal, and/or dramatic clothes are ideal
- Gloves, sunglasses, and other accessories are great to have as well
- Solid colors are preferred over patterns because they can blend with more kinds of background elements
- Themed props and costumes are a plus
- See the list of **themes** below for ideas!

I also have a small amount of props and themed clothing.

## Themes

### Surreal

Worlds with exotic and minimalistic features that canâ€™t exist in the known universe.

**Wardrobe**: Formal wear, dresses, capes, solid colors, carnival wear (masks, wings, etc).
