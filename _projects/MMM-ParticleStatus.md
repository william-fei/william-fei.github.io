caption: An Magic Mirror Module for ParticleIO devices
description: >
    Created a Magic Mirror Module to help display data about the status of my backyard garden. I have small, battery-powered, and mesh-networked devices across my garden that collect information that I made call In-Plants. And now he also has an easy way to collect and monitor all that information in one place! But this Magic Mirror Module will work for ALL ParticleIO events. If your interested in replicating my setup, follow the tutorial below.

    To make my 7" Raspberry Pi display work against a glass surface work I also designed and printed custom Pi Display Hooks that you can also find on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4345616).
