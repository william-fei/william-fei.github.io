caption: DSLM using a Raspberry Pi ðŸ“¸
description: >
    The Raspberry Pi Foundation came out with a really sweet HQ Camera Module this last May. With specs including a 12.3 MegaPixel sensor, C- and CS-mount lenses, and tripod mounting support - I got really excited to put my design skill to work to create an enclosure that could transform the new module into a standalone DSLM (Digital Single Lens Mirrorless). Something that I could charge up, and take with me to take pictures of personal projects, nature, and friends. So I took the time to design out an enclosure that employs a Raspberry Pi UPS, a 3.5" touchscreen, and a modular handgrip design so other DIY makers like myself can play with an open-source DSLM!
