  Decided to make something for Halloween so made Alan Rails Ghost Whistle from
  <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw3NPqa5IdE" target="_blank">Rick and Morty</a>.

  It was pretty simple to hack together, just a redesigned 3D print, some glow in the dark paint, and leds. <br>
  Got a lot of positive feedback from it (over 5000 likes on a Facebook fan page), and got my cosplay featured in an art install.
