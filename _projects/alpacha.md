caption: Semi-autonomous twitter bot.
description: >
    Created a semi-autonomous bot to create twitter content.
    <br> The premise is pretty simple, it scrapes multiple reddit boards for new content (less than 2 minutes old) and allows you to post that content on twitter<br>
    It also reminds you every few hours to post new content, to keep your followers engaged. This application was made using PhoneGap so it can be used on both iOS and Android devices.
