caption: Printed some arcade controllers for my RetroPi
description: >
    Spent some time printing out, finishing, and painting some arcade controllers for my Retropi build. Just two different controllers, one using red LED buttons and the other one using blue LED buttons. This is an upgrade from my previous [RetroPi arcade build from 2018](http://nickengmann.com/projects/arcade-cabinet/).
