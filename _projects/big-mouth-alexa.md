    Custom housing for smart home utility tool utilizing an ArduinoUNO and Audio to DC Converter.<br> 
    Or in laymans terms, I took the audio output of Amazon's Alexa and funneled it through a Arduino to convert the audio into DC motor movements.<br> 
    Fun and hilarious hardware hack inspired by an <a class="link" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Animate-a-Billy-Bass-Mouth-With-Any-Audio-Source/?ALLSTEPS" target="_blank">instructable's guide </a>.<br>
    The orignial guide only included lip movements and I customized it to add in head and tail movements of the Billy Bass Fish.
