caption: Enabling a community of people to follow their passions
description: >
    Since January I have been working together with my roommate/partner in crime [Niko Lazaris](http://niko.pizza/) to help enable developers/activists across NYC to create their passion projects. 
    <br>
    <br>
    To do this we made a meetup group called "Bugs and Brews" where individuals can meetup once a week for 3-4 hours and work on their passion projects. And at the end of the 3-4 hour session individuals show off what they have accomplished this week and set goals for themselves for the next week.
    <br>
    <br>
    If you live in the NYC area and would like to join us, hit up our [onboarding website](https://bugsandbrews.nyc) for more details!
