caption: Get a phone alert when someone enters the room
description: >
    Casa Controlar is the beginning of a fun longterm Internet of Things project<br>
    The concept of the "Internet of Things", or IoT is the concept of attaching internet connectivity to everyday items in the home.
    <br> I've begun undergoing creating multiple internet of things products for my apartment, all of which I can either control or get data from using a smartphone application I made called Casa Controlar.
    <br>
    Currently Casa Controlar is set up just to control my door alarm, which gives me a phone alert in the form of an on screen notification and musical notification when a friend enters my apartment.<br>
