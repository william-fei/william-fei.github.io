    In order to improve my SMD soldering skills while building something that I'd actually use, I purchased and created two [crkbd](https://keyhive.xyz/corne) split keyboards. Went with two different custom builds - one utilizing MX Cherry Red keys with custom keycaps from a japanese artist, and another more simple build with MX Cherry Blues and plain grey keycaps. All the keyboards are controlled using [Elite-C](https://keyhive.xyz/shop/elite-c) microcontrollers. Planning on making one more build when my [crkbd v3](https://keyhive.xyz/shop/corne-v3) boards come in. 

    There are plenty of [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bB9A1YYyII&t) online if you are interested in making a custom keyboard, and they also make for dope custom gifts for the nerd in your life ❤️
