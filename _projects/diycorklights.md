caption: Want to upcycle used wine/liquor bottles? Turn them into simple LED art!
description: >
    Got some spare bottles around? Have access to a 3D printer? Rule of threes so I should have come up with another rhetorical question? Great! You should take some time to make some DIY LED Corks.

    I recently moved to New York and trying to decorate my apartment by upcycling things that I would otherwise throw away or recycle. I saw some Cork Wine Bottle Lights on Amazon and realized I had all the pieces in my apartment to create my own DIY version of LED Cork lights.

    Check out the [instructional guide I made](https://bit.ly/cork-lights) to make your own!
