description: >
    Decided to revisit my DJ Soundboard project and improve on it. I have added a Kentec Touchscreen display which has allowed me to utilize many more buttons for the Soundboard. With more buttons comes the ability to layer more tracks.
    <br>
    # Technical Specifics:<br>
    Coded on KeilUVision in C++. Uses a Kentec Touchscreen for display and a TMC1234 Launchpad for processing. <br>
    Has an AUX Cable output for sound.
