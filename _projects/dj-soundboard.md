    This project was my final project for my EE445L course. In this course we spend weeks developing hardware/software projects. Over the course of three weeks my labpartner and I created a DJ Soundboard. The soundboard had 4 functioning buttons which each produced a different sound. These sounds could be layered to create fully functional musical tracks. We also designed and created our own PCB for this project.
