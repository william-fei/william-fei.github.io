caption: Upgrade to a Multicolor Eink
description: >
    Bought a few different multicolored colored Eink monitors, including the 7 inch 5b (HD) and 7 in 5b (V2) eink monitors. Adjusted BenRoe's original codebase to work for either the 7in black/white Eink monitor or either of the colored eink monitors that I purchased.
