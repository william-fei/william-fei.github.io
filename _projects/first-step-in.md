    Worked with a team of developers to create a webpage containing information for refugees in Austin Texas.
    <br> The website uses React and Express for routing, and grabs information from google docs and google sheets using Sheetrock.<br>
    It also uses firebase to create user accounts/sign ins and store user information on the backend.<br>
