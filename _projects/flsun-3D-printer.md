caption: Guide on setting up my FLSUN 3D Printer
description: >
    Buying a DIY kit and building my own 3D printer ended up being one of the most stressful projects I've ever embarked on.
    <br>
    I ended up putting about 80 hours into a $200 kit, just to get the initial printer working. <br>
    This was due to roughly translated instructions, vague videos, and to be honest - a lot of inexperience on my part. <br>
    So I decided to make this repo that details some of my journey incase it can help anyone else that wants to do something similar.
