caption: PC convertered to run MacOS
description: >
    In the pursuit to make some iOS applications I created a hackintosh.<br>
    A Hackintosh is a PC that is convertered to run macOS. In order to run a non native operating system a lot of steps are involved.
    <br>
    This was a super frustrating project that taught me a lot about how the Macintosh operating system works, so I'll be uploading a tutorial blog post FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY later.<br>
