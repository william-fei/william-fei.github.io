caption: Chrome Extension to motivate people when they create new tabs
description: >
    Incentive is a Chrome Extension used to help motivate people to finish their tasks/projects/and goals.<br>
    Incentive was the first chrome extension I've ever created and it was inspired by the Chrome Extension <a class="link" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/motivation/ofdgfpchbidcgncgfpdlpclnpaemakoj?hl=en" target="_blank">Motivation"</a>.
    <br> The goal of Incentive is to inspire people to reach their goals by giving them
    reminders of how close the deadline to their goals is.</br> Individuals can customly add their own goals to Incentive, and in the future, change the color scheme/background images.
