caption: Using a Myo to do some cool spy stuff
description: >
    I created a application using a Myo that is able to implement some "spy" actions that I always wanted in real life. This phone-hardware application is able to record conversations, create notes, and fake phone calls discretely without ever taking out your phone.<br>
    This application was created using the backend from the sample HelloWorld project that Myo provides.<br>
    From there I added a splash screen, multiple menu options and the various features mentioned.<br>
