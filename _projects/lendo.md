    *Currently-in-Progress*:
    I am currently the project manager for Peer to Peer lending (P2P Lending). P2P Lending is a web application actively being developed by [Open San Diego](https://opensandiego.org) in partnership with the [San Diego Linda Vista Library branch](https://www.sandiego.gov/public-library/locations/linda-vista-library) to facilitate community peer-to-peer lending. The goal is to help community members share books and media outside of the SD Library's collection (specifically foreign language books) with the help of the library. The Library staff will faciltate the loans with this application so that there is both trust and anonymity in the lending.
