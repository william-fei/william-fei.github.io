caption: What is McCarthyism?
description: >
    On February 14th I got some pretty horrible news. The internship that I had moved to Washington, D.C. for had been revoked due to complications with my background check. Specifically because of where I was born, Tripoli, Libya, I was denied the opportunity to prove myself. In the days that followed I induldged myself in completing the following project. It began as a way to keep myself busy but as I invested more time into it I realized that the message that I wanted to prove was a just one. <br>
    This project is about McCarthyism, its roots and how it effects indidivudals today and now.
