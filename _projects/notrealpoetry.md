description: >
    I redesigned the classic "Hello My Name Is" sticker into a sticker that individuals can write how they are feeling on. This would allow individuals to express both positive or negative feelings anonymously.  
    <br>
    <br>
    In order to capture individuals outputs and share them with a community I created an accompanying Instagram and Twitter account.
    <br>
    <br>
    Finally I created a webportal where people can also anonymously share how they are feeling and have these feelings captured and spat out on the Twitter account @NotRealPoetry.
