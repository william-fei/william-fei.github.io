caption: Webapp to show nearby MAC addresses of wifi enabled devices and pinpoint their locations
description: >
    PiSight is a platform that can analyze the mac addresses of all nearby devices that are wifi enabled.<br>
    By identifying the nearby devices you can both keep track of inflow and outflow of individuals in networked locations. This is a cheap way for cities or governments to analyze secure locations in cases of emergencies. This technology also has the ability to triangulate locations of wifi enabled devices.
