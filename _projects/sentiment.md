caption: Human emotion identifier
description: >
    Sentiment is a Plantronics sponsored application which identifies human emotion in speech. The application offers its user an emotion recognition analysis service by extracting vocal parameters indicative of emotional states for incoming audio through a phone call. Sentiment may provide audio and display notifications to the user based on the user's desired Settings.This project spanned from Fall 2014 - Spring 2015 as part of my senior design project. I developed Sentiment in conjunction with a team of five students and a faculty mentor. My main contribution to this project was dealing with the initial speech processing and developing the algorithm using a Java based machine learning platform.
