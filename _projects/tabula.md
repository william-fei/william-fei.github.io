description: >
    Tabula is a chrome extension to allow users to better memorize their notes while they browse the web.
    <br> Tabula replaces ad content with your personal notes to better help you learn and remember the things that are important to you, instead of getting bombarded with materialistic and obtrusive ads.
    <br> Tabula imports your notes from various note taking apps including: OneNote, EverNote, and Albus.
