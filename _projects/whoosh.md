caption: Webapp to express your Emotions
description: >
    Whoosh is a web-app created to allow people to express their emotions anonymously online.<br>
    Whoosh allows a user to vent their feelings out, and explore the feelings of other people who are also feeling similarly.<br>
    It's a simple concept, wrapped together in a beautiful User Interface. This was all made possible with the help of three.js and Watsons Sentiment analysis.Whoosh was created at the CodeRED -2016 hackathon.
