# Hey! ðŸŽ‰
I am Nick Engmann and I hack and design hardware and web dev projects to try & stand out in the crowd and mentor the engineers of tomorrow.

I created this personal website as a means to keep track of my creations, talk about my experience as an Engineer, and give guidance to anyone looking for someone with my expertise.
