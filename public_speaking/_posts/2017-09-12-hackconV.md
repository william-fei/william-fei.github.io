In December of 2015 I joined an organization called **Major League Hacking**.

Major League Hacking (MLH) is the official student hackathon league. Each year, we power over 200 weekend-long invention competitions that inspire innovation, cultivate communities and teach computer science skills to more than 65,000 students around the world. MLH is an engaged and passionate maker community, consisting of the next generation of technology leaders and entrepreneurs.

I joined MLH as a **Coach**.

Major League Hacking Coaches are community members who represent Major League Hacking at events. Coaches are the people you want at every hackathon. They are passionate hackers and community members who love to teach and support peers of all skill levels. MLH Coaches are at your events mentoring hackers and supporting organizers. They can be found debugging your code in the middle of the night, ensuring judging goes smoothly, or even taking out the trash (both literally and figuratively). Coaches are hackathon superheroes, without the capes, masks and lassos of truth.

I wanted to let the community know more about the Coaches program and how we can be useful to them so [I gave a talk at HackCon V](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBeg1iXM098) about how to handle event managing and how to best utilize the Coaches present at the events.
Gave a talk at HackCon V about how to handle event managing.
                        
Used analogies about how event coordinators are firefighters.
