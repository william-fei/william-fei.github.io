[CyberFire](https://cyberfire.energy.gov/) events are led by expert security investigators from United States Department of Energy National Laboratories. Our instructors have performed cybersecurity investigation and research continuously since 2005. Every year they hold a Capture The Flag (CTF) event at their various trainings. This year my team and I took home first place! There was no prize for winning, but it felt great to compete with other skilled cybersecurity proffesionals!
