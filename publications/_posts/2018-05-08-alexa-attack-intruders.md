Spent about 2 months making a fun and safe Alexa enabled Nerf Gun Turret and [published the instructions to create it](https://www.hackster.io/quodcertamine/nerf-alexa-home-defense-turrent-a50dd1) it back in May 2018.

It recieved a lot of great praise and my favorite Hacker website Hackaday decided a [publish a story on it](https://hackaday.com/2018/05/08/alexa-attack-intruders/).
