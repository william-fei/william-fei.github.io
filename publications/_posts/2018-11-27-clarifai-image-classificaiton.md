Towards the end of my Coaching career with Major League Hacking they introduced a technical writing aspect to the job. 

You could write a technical piece about how to recreate a Hackathon project or even improve on a hackathon project and publish it through their [Medium](https://stories.mlh.io) platform.

I decided to spend time writing my first Medium [article](https://stories.mlh.io/powering-your-e-commerce-application-with-image-classification-831558869a0d) about how to make an image classification application in a few simple steps.
