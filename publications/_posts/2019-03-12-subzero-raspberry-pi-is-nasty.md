Spent a few weeks working with cybersecurity researcher [Josiah Bryant](https://halcyonic.us) making a device to allow users to quickly and securely share files locally. For example, imagine you were having a get together with friends to talka bout your last big trip. If you all had tons of images/videos which you wanted to share with each other but you didn't want to publish it to a coporate cloud [like Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_regarding_Google), you could just utilize our solution to privately share those files amongst each other.

We [published the instructions to create SUBZero](https://www.hackster.io/135000/subzero-a-simple-network-attached-storage-device-3f47be) back in January 2019. We got a lot of great feedback from the project so we decided to reach out to my favorite Hacker website Hackaday in order to [publish a story on it](https://hackaday.com/2019/03/12/this-raspberry-pi-is-nasty/). Check it out and let me know what you think!
