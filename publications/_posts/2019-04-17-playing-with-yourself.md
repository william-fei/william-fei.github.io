I've been making side projects religiously for the past 3 years and it's been a remarkable experience. I went from making hacked together kindergarten level phone applications that only [DJKhaled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6grfHNs3ok&feature=youtu.be) would like - to making projects that [I am incredibly proud of](https://www.hackster.io/nick-engmann/in-plants-plant-soil-monitor-powered-by-particle-mesh-1a17f6).

In order to celebrate the hard work I've put into my projects as well as give back to the community that has helped me create so many gems - I published a [blog post](https://hackernoon.com/playing-with-yourself-the-power-of-personal-projects-206047344121). Inside the blog post you will find valuable resources that have helped me create many of the hardware and software projects around my lab, as well as my story of personal growth over the past few years.

Check it out and let me know what you think!
