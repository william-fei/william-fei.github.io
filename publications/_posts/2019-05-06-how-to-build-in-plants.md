At the beginning of the year I spent some time manufacturing some devices to help keep my houseplants alive, which I named In-Plants. After originally publishing my write up on [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/nick-engmann/in-plants-plant-soil-monitor-powered-by-particle-mesh-1a17f6), my efforts were noticed by the hardware company [Particle.io](https://www.particle.io/). They happily worked with me to republish my blog [post](https://blog.particle.io/2019/05/06/learn-how-to-build-in-plants-a-mesh-connected-soil-monitoring-system/) on their website.
