> [Hackster](https://www.hackster.io/) is the world's largest network for hardware & software developers. With 1,100,000+ members and 18,000+ projects, beginners and professionals can learn and share how to build robotics, industrial automation systems, AI-powered machines, and everything in between.
<br>
For the past three years I've been both publishing and following tons of writers, inventors and creatives on Hackster.io. The website maintains an inspirational community that help promote fun side projects and ingenuis inventions. Which is why I couldn't be happier that I was approached with an opporunity to start tech-blogging for the community.<br>
<br>
As a technical writer I'll be responsible for finding cool technical hardware or software projects online, summarizing them so the average user can understand them, and publishing that material for Hackster's viewership.
