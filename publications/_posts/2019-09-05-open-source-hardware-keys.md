Published my second piece on [Hackster](https://www.hackster.io/) this time focusing on some other main interests of mine, cybersecurity and the open-sourced community.
<br>
If you store any aspect of personal data on the internet, then you can understand how important cybersecurity can be. We want to protect our data using high-tech cybersecurity tools but I also believe that is an important for these tools to be public facing, and not hiding any secrets behind closed doors. The Cybersecurity company that I talk about in my second piece [SoloKeys](https://solokeys.com/), shares this world view and I couldn't be more excited for the products they are currently developing. <br>
<br>
But I won't spoil anything for you, feel free to check out my [second piece over on the Hackster blog](https://bit.ly/open-source-key) for more details!
